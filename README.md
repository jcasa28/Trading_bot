I used the MetaTrader 5 app to run the script and coded it within the MetaTrader 5 IDE. Initially, I planned to use the MQL5 Library with Python, 
but since the MQL5 Library Python version only supports Windows,
I had to switch to C++ which is the language supported by the MetaTrader IDE. Additionally, because Iâ€™m working on a Mac,
I utilized WINE to run MetaTrader 5.
